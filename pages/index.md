# Engineering Excellence Meets Creative Innovation

![Profile Image](assets/profile.jpg)

Welcome! I'm Jason Connor, a seasoned software engineer who thrives at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and practical innovation. Armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science specializing in algorithm analysis and parallel computing, I've built a career crafting robust solutions across local, distributed, and cloud-based services.

## Technical Expertise

My engineering toolkit spans multiple languages and paradigms, including Python, Golang, SQL, and JavaScript, TypeScript. I'm passionate about efficient workflows and leverage the power of CLI tools â€“ you'll find me navigating through projects using Vim, database CLI clients, and other tools that promote understanding, collaboration and productivity.

In the containerization space, I'm well-versed in Docker for both professional and personal projects, I bring enterprise-level experience with Kubernetes deployments and cloud-native solutions, such as AWS Lambda and GCP Cloud Functions.

Always at the forefront of innovation, I've embraced AI-driven development by leveraging the latest LLMs by integrating them into my development environments and diving into the latest tools, such as [vim-ai](https://github.com/madox2/vim-ai), [vim-codeium](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim), [aider](https://aider.chat), [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai) and [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com).

## The Maker's Spirit

Beyond code, I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity to create and build. My projects span diverse domains:

- **Audio Engineering**: Currently crafting a DIY headphone amplifier and building my second pair of speakers
- **Culinary Arts**: Advocate of **mise en place**, I approach cooking as an engineer, preparing foodstuffs in advance for ease and convenience when it matters
- **DIY Projects**: From building my own bicycle, my desk, to past adventures in homebrewing and urban gardening, I love building almost anything

## Literary Pursuits

An avid reader with kitsch tastes, I dive into curated selections of sci-fi, fantasy, and thrillers, always hunting for those hidden gems rated 4+ on Goodreads. Occasionally, you'll find me exploring thought-provoking non-fiction works that challenge conventional thinking.
