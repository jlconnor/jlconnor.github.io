# Engineering Excellence Meets Creative Innovation

![Profile Image](assets/profile.jpg)

Welcome! I'm Jason Connor, a seasoned software engineer who thrives at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and practical innovation. Armed with a Master's degree in Computer Science specializing in algorithm analysis and parallel computing, I've built a career crafting robust solutions across local, distributed, and cloud-based services.

## Technical Expertise

My engineering toolkit spans multiple languages and paradigms, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and Golang. I'm passionate about efficient workflows and leverage the power of CLI tools â€“ you'll find me navigating through projects using Vim, database CLI clients, and other tools that promote understanding, collaboration and productivity.

In the containerization space, I'm well-versed in Docker for both professional and personal projects, and I bring enterprise-level experience with Kubernetes deployments as well as cloud-native solutions, such as AWS Lambda and GCP Cloud Functions.

Always at the forefront of innovation, I've embraced AI-driven development by integrating tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and even experimenting with locally-hosted open-source models through Ollama, including Llama and Qwen. I'm currently building this website with Windsurf.

## The Maker's Spirit

Beyond code, I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity to create and build. My projects span diverse domains:

- **Audio Engineering**: Currently crafting a custom headphone amplifier and designing my second pair of speakers
- **Culinary Arts**: Mastering the art of sauce-making, from classic pomodoro to vibrant enchilada sauces, all optimized for convenient meal prep
- **DIY Projects**: From building my own bicycle to past adventures in homebrewing and urban gardening, with hydroponics, in beautiful Colorado

## Literary Pursuits

An avid reader with eclectic tastes, I dive into carefully curated selections of sci-fi, fantasy, and thrillers, always hunting for those hidden gems rated 4+ on Goodreads. Occasionally, you'll find me exploring thought-provoking dramas and non-fiction works that challenge conventional thinking.
