# Hello World

![Profile Image](assets/profile.jpg)

I'm Jason Connor, a long-time engineer and tech enthusiast. I graduated with a Master's degree in computer science, concentrating on algorithm analysis and parallel computing. A true (at the time) LeetCode nerd, but rather rusty anymore. It turns out it's not really something that you use much in industry. Well, outside interviews.

I've since made a career working on local, distributed, and cloud services. I've been lucky enough to spend my career programming in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and most recently, Golang.

I'm a hardcore CLI enthusiast who uses Vim (the original, not Neovim), pgcli, snowflakecli, rediscli, and others to interact with my programming environment.

I also regularly use Docker (for work and personal projects) and Kubernetes (just for work).

That said, I'm interested in the most recent trends and have played around with Elixir and have integrated AI into my workflows, leveraging Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and even open-source (locally run with Ollama) models like Llama and Qwen.

I like to play around with a number of different projects, most of which don't really go anywhere once I've learned whatever technology I was interested in.

## Other Interests

In my free time, I love to make and build things.

This includes cooking, where I like to make large batches of sauces like pomodoro, pesto, pizza, red and green chilies, and red and green enchilada sauces that I can freeze for weeknight convenience.

I built my bike, have built one pair of speakers and am working on another (when it's warm), and I'm currently building a headphone amplifier.

I've brewed my own beer (though I've stopped as I don't drink very much anymore), grown my own marijuana (legal where I live in Colorado), and had a garden (though stopped when we got our Boston Terrier, Lilo).

I love to read, mostly kitsch sci-fi, fantasy, and thrillers, but occasionally drama or non-fiction. I usually choose books by looking for anything rated 4+ on Goodreads.

The plan is to use this site as a compilation of everything I like. I'll try to post projects, recipes, book recommendations, code snippets, and anything else I can think of here.

This is really just to make sure my customization of the html generation is working for syntax highlighting. Thank you pygments!
